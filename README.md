## Readium as CSS Reset

In order to reset CSS styles I'm using the readium CSS reset file.

Cloned from the [Readium-css](https://github.com/readium/readium-css) repository.


## Production version

To get the production version use `npm run build` and get the `viewer.js` located in `web/js/viewer.js`.
